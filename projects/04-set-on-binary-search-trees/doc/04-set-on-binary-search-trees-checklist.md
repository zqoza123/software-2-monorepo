## Getting Started Tasks

- [ ] We have followed the recommended approach for getting started
  - [ ] We have read this document top to bottom
  - [ ] We have reviewed the project instructions for this assignment
  - [ ] We have reviewed the rubric for this assignment
  - [ ] We have considered the estimated time to complete the assignment
  - [ ] We have referred to testing resources that could help us write a systematic test plan
    - [ ] We have referred to the [QueueOnSequence lab][queue-on-sequence]
    - [ ] We have referred to the [5 Beginner Tricks for Writing Your Own Tests][5-tricks-for-testing] article

## Ongoing Tasks

- [ ] We have followed the project instructions
  - [ ] We have setup the Eclipse project according to the [project description][project]
  - [ ] We have implemented all of the private methods:
    - [ ] We have completed `createNewRep()`
    - [ ] We have completed `isInTree()`
    - [ ] We have completed `insertInTree()`
    - [ ] We have completed `removeSmallest()`
    - [ ] We have completed `removeFromTree()`
  - [ ] We have implemented the no-argument constructor
  - [ ] We have implemented all of the kernel methods:
    - [ ] We have completed `add()`
    - [ ] We have completed `remove()`
    - [ ] We have completed `removeAny()`
    - [ ] We have completed `contains()`
    - [ ] We have completed `size()`
  - [ ] We have adhered to the representation invariant listed in the `@convention` tag in our methods
        (i.e., our methods do not modify the representation in a way that violates the convention)
  - [ ] We have adhered to the abstraction function listed in the `@correspondence` tag in our methods
        (i.e., our methods do not assume an interpretation of the representation that differs from the correspondence)
- [ ] We have tested our project code (**note**: tests may fail if not all kernel methods are implemented)
  - [ ] We have referred to our [Set on Queue][set-on-queue] lab code and refined it as needed
  - [ ] We have developed a systematic test plan for the Set implementation (**note**: consider a "0, 1, many" approach)
    - [ ] We have tested `add()`
    - [ ] We have tested `remove()`
    - [ ] We have tested `removeAny()`, taking care to not test implementation details
    - [ ] We have tested `contains()`
    - [ ] We have tested `size()`
    - [ ] We have tested the default constructor
- [ ] We have considered best practices
  - [ ] We have added our names in separate `@author` tags
  - [ ] We have addressed all spotbugs and checkstyle warnings
  - [ ] We have regularly committed changes to the project files using version control with good commit messages
  - [ ] We have regularly updated our local copies of the project files using version control and handled any merge conflicts

## Submission Tasks

- [ ] We have followed the submission instructions
  - [ ] We have created a zip archive of our project directory
  - [ ] We have created PDF(s) of our project file(s)
  - [ ] We have submitted the zip archive to Carmen
  - [ ] We have submitted the PDF(s) to Carmen
