| Students should be able to write a kernel class for a new type and its kernel operations (List with the extra retreat method) | Correctness    | 6      | (0) No evidence of an attempt to write a kernel class          | (2) An attempt is made to write a kernel class, but there are several major bugs                    | (4) A kernel class is written, but there are some minor bugs           | (6) A correct kernel class is written with a special attention to details such as adhering to the correspondence                                                                                                                                       |
| Students should be able to develop and use specification-based test plans                                                     | Testing        | 2      | (0) No testing plan is provided                                | (.5) An attempt to create a testing plan is made but misses several important test cases            | (1) A thorough testing plan is created but misses a few key edge cases | (2) A complete test case is made that mirrors the design pattern discussed in class (see QueueOnSequence for an example of our expectations)                                                                                                           |
| Students should be able to follow the software sequence best practices (within reason)                                        | Best Practices | 2      | (0) No evidence of software sequence best practices being used | (.5) An attempt to follow software sequence best practices is made, but there are some major errors | (1.5) Software sequence best practices are followed with minor errors  | (2) Software sequence best practices are properly followed (e.g., code includes helpful comments, checkstyle and findbugs warnings are missing, and project is submitted correctly)â€”see project checklist, if provided, for best practices to consider |
