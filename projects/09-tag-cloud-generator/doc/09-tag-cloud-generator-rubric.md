| Students should be able to design and code a realistic component-based application program without being provided a skeleton solution | Correctness    | 2      | (0) No evidence of designing and coding a realistic component-based application program without being provided a skeleton solution | (.5) An attempt is made to design and code a realistic component-based application program without being provided a skeleton solution, but there are significant bugs | (1) A realistic component-based application program is designed and coded without being provided a skeleton solution, but there are minor bugs | (2) A realistic and correct component-based application program is designed and coded without being provided a skeleton solution (i.e., the program is broken down into reasonable methods with reasonable contracts)                                  |
| Students should be able to use "collection" components (e.g., Map and SortingMachine)                                                 | Correctness    | 3      | (0) No evidence of using collection components or Java Standard components are used                                                | (1) An attempt is made to use collection components, but there are significant bugs                                                                                   | (2) Collection components are used, but there are minor bugs                                                                                   | (3) Collection components are used correctly to achieve the expected tag cloud (i.e., Map and SortingMachine are used in a way that can handle a variety of input data sets)                                                                           |
